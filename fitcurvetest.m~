% IN THE CODE BELOW, I switched btwn r = lognrnd generated data and r = the actual data
% (catvalues). With the fake data the fit works well. With the actual data
% it doesn't. Since these are running in the same function. And the fake
% data has the same mean and variance as the real data, I am not sure what
% the problem/difference is. THe only thing I can think of is that the real
% data is not close enough to lognormally distributed to get a good enough
% fit.

%generate random data to mimic real data
m =  mean(catvalues);
v = var(catvalues);
mu = log((m^2)/sqrt(v+m^2));
sigma = sqrt(log(v/(m^2)+1));%
r = lognrnd(mu,sigma,1,10000); %should be normallydistributed when log
%r = catvalues;

logr = log(r);
maxlogr = max(logr);
maxval = max(r);
upperlim = ceil(log10(maxval));
xlin = linspace(0,maxlogr,50);
xlog = logspace(-3,upperlim,50);

%take out zero values
for k = length(catvalues):-1:1 % bc columns being deleted as loop runs need to go from end to beginning so indexes not changed
        if catvalues(k) == 0
           catvalues(k) = [];
        end
end
